# Get also power and energy for methods starting with this package.class.method name
# Example: filter-method-names=Package to filter energy for all methods whose full name start with Package
# Note that JoularJX will always generate energy for all non-filtered method in a separate file
# So you can safely keep this empty if you don't want to filter methods
# You can add multiple identifiers names separated by a comma, ordered by priority
# JoularJX will monitor and filter methods for all these packages
# Example: filter-method-names=Package,Package2,Package3
